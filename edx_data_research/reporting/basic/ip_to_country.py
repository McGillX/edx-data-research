'''
This module retrieve IP addresses for each student and maps their IP to a country
This is to determine the diversity of students who took a given course
The geoip module and GeoIP.dat file was used to map the IP address to a country

Each user may have multiple ips, so this module retrieves all the countries
mapped to those ips. Disclaimer: The accuracy of the IP to Country cannot be
determined as it is difficult to determine if the IP is an actual IP or a proxy IP

At the end of the analysis, the results are used to create a Pie Chart to
visualize the distribution
