## Overview

The folder problem_ids deals with analysis of all the problem ids that are created for a specific course. To simplify the analysis, we would extract all relevant problem ids of the course and the solutions given to those problem ids by the students and save it to a new collection and we would do the analysis on that new collection

## Getting Started

### Creating New Collection

Run the following script to create new collection
  
    $ python create_problem_ids_collection.py
