'''
This module extracts all of the comments and comment threads from the forum of 
a given course. Using NLTK, all of the comments and comment threads will be 
parsed into a list of words which will be then used to create a word cloud 
using http://www.wordle.net/create 

Usage:

python forum_body_extraction_for_word_cloud.py > word_cloud.txt

The above command would get the top 1000 words and print those words the
number of times they were used and the result is outputted to a text file,
e.g. word_cloud.txt. User can copy the text in word_cloud.txt and paste in
http://www.wordle.net/create to generate the word cloud
