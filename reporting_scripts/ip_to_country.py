'''
This module retrieve IP addresses for each student and maps their IP to a country
This is to determine the diversity of students who took a given course
The geoip module and GeoIP.dat file was used to map the IP address to a country

Each user may have multiple ips, so this module retrieves all the countries mapped to those ips
Disclaimer: The accuracy of the IP to Country cannot be determined as it is difficult to determine
if the IP is an actual IP or a proxy IP

At the end of the analysis, the results are used to create a Pie Chart to visualize the distribution

Usage:
python ip_to_country.py <db_name>
